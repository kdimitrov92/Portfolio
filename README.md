# Portfolio
**Description:**
The web application, as the name suggests, will be used for image showcasing, blog sharing, and in general to be used as a portfolio by photographers/writers. It allows photos to be uploaded in multiple versions, to be commented and rated. It allows posting of blogs and comments to them as well. Every person will have a public portfolio page that is accessed via their username and showcases their work and gives an access point to everything they have posted.
